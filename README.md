## Project Overview

I just need access to a soldering station for this project.

The goal is to take a baby fisher price controller and interface it with an arduino nano to work as a functional controller. There is an arduino library to send data for a gamecube controller. The inputs from the controller will be soldered to an arduino nano which will communicate send the data out through a gamecube controller cable. 

I chose to convert this to a gamecube controller because these controllers are commonly used in Super Smash Bros Ultimate and have an adapter to be used on a Nintendo Switch or on a computer.

## Educational Value Added

Soldering skills, project design, arduino coding.
